# clusteranalysis

This project completed during training(data science cource).

Clustering is a UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING.

In this project i used pandas library for csv reading, numpy library, matplotlib library for visualisation of clusters and sklearn library for kmeans cluster algorithm.

This code devide the data fields into K(No. of clusters) clusters. Each cluster has approximately similar characteristics of fields of the data.

After analysis we can also predict that which field will corresponds which cluster.

we can also get the centroid of the each cluster.
